"Note: Federal surveys now give respondents the option of reporting more than one race.  Therefore, two basic ways of defiing a race group are possible. A group such as Asian may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
